***********XYZ AUCTIONING SYSTEM************
In this auctioning system, both the sellera and the buyer can separately register.
After registration an account is created for them. After logging into that account 
through correct user id and password they can gain access to the system.
Inside the seller module, the seller can check the list of items currently available for auctioning
and place a bid on them.
Inside the buyer module, the buyer can insert an item for auction.
